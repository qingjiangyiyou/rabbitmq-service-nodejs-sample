/!\ Repository moved to GitHub: https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-service-nodejs-sample
    This is a stale read-only repository.

This is a simple Node.JS application demonstrating the use of the
RabbitMQ service on Cloud Foundry and Heroku.

To run locally, make sure RabbitMQ is running, then:

    $ npm install
    $ node app.js

or, in the Heroku way:

    $ gem install foreman
    $ npm install
    $ foreman start
